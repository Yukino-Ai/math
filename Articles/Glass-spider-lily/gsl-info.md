## Tasks

The followin tasks might be useful for building intuition about Ramsey theory.

### Try to prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic

- Restate Theorem `1.1` in terms of partion regularity

#### Show Euclid's theorem (as a corollary or via another proof)

- Are there Ramsey theory flavors of these results or their proof(s)?

### Try to prove Ramsey's theorem

- Intuition for graph-based results in Ramsey theory

### Try to prove Van der Waerden's theorem

- Intuition for arithmetic progression-based results in Ramsey theory
