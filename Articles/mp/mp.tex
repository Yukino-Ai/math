\subsection{Statistical inference}

Given random variables sampled from an underlying population with an unkown probability distribution (could be fully parametric, non-parametric, and semi-parametric), what can we say about this distribution?

\subsection{Descriptive statistics}

Given random variables which are not assumed to come from an underlying population, what can we say about these random variables themselves?
(For example, the standard deviation $\sigma$ is a descriptives statistic.)
\section{Mathematical foundations for hypothesis testing}

Hypothesis testing (p-values and confidence intervals) $\dots \leftarrow$ central limit theorems $\dots \leftarrow$ statistical inference
